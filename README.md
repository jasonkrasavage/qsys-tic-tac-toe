# Tic Tac Toe

This is an implementation of the game tic tac toe within a Q-SYS plugin. It allows you to play against the computer, as well as choose your letter that you play with. Within a sesion, it will keep track of wins and losses on both sides.  The AI/computer operates in a simple manner. First, it checks to see if it can win, then it checks to see if it can block the player from winning, and lastly, if it can't do either, it will chose one of it's available moves.

## PluginCompile

This plugin was created using the [Basic Plugin Framework](https://q-syshelp.qsc.com/DeveloperHelp/Content/Code_Examples/Basic_Plugin_Framework.htm#:~:text=Q%2DSYS%20plugins%20are%20small,it%20within%20the%20correct%20directory.) from Q-SYS, and scaled back to use only the necessary .lua files.
